This problem is similar to the String Palindrome problem we have discussed above. If you can solve that problem, you can solve this as well. You can use indexOf() or substring() to reverse a String or alternatively, convert the problem to reverse an array by operating on character array instead of String. If you want to brush up your data structure skill you can also check Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java course on Udemy before solving this question.
