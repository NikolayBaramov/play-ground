Hello guys, today's programming exercise is to write a program to find repeated characters in a String. For example, if given input to your program is "Java", it should print all duplicates characters, i.e. characters appear more than once in String and their count like a = 2 because of character 'a' has appeared twice in String "Java". This is also a very popular coding question on the various level of Java interviews and written tests, where you need to write code. On difficulty level, this question is at par with the prime numbers or Fibonacci series, which are also very popular on junior level Java programming interviews and it's expected from every programmer to know how to solve them.
